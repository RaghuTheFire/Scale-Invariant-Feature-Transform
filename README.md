# ObjectTracking-SIFT-Algorithm

Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is a powerful computer vision algorithm designed to detect, describe, and match local features in images and videos.  It operates by identifying distinctive key points (interest points) that are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination. These key points serve as robust descriptors for recognizing objects and patterns.
